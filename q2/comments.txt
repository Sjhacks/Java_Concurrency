Question2:
Nothing in my program was explicitly synchronized other than the counter for the number
of blank pixels remaining in image. That said, the program experienced major slowdown when running
multiple threads, most likely due to blocking on methods like setRgb. It is noticeable though that
after a certain number of threads, the slowdown stops increasing. This is probably due to architecture, I
ran this program on a quad core machine, so eventually, the number of threads is higher than can be run simultaneously
in an efficient way and the program stops slowing down.
